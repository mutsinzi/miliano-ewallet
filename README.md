# Strategy

This strategy focuses on using best practices in software engineering, promoting departmental collaboration, and carefully planning and executing both backend and frontend needs.

| Phase | Activity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Requirement Gathering, Planning & Estimation** | Stakeholder Meetings | Conduct kickoff meetings with tech team, business units, UI/UX designers, and product owner to establish vision, objectives, and priorities for Miliano-eWallet system. |
|  | Requirement Gathering | Collaborate with business teams and experts to gather detailed requirements and understand the limitations of the legacy system to create a new design. |
|  | Technology Stack Selection | Choose a modern, scalable, and maintainable backend technology stack like Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis for their performance and scalability features. |
|  | Architecture Design | The backend was designed to accommodate 1 million users, using microservices for modularity and Redis for efficient caching strategies. |
| **Phase 2: Design and Development** | API Contract Definition | In collaboration with frontend teams, define API contracts using Swagger for clear, documented communication protocols. |
|  | Agile Development Process | Adopt an Agile methodology for iterative development, with sprints planned around the roadmap milestones. Engage the Scrum Master to facilitate sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. |
|  | Implementation | Start backend development, adhering to coding standards, and implementing best practices for security, data modeling, and business logic. |
|  | Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) | Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and facilitating rapid iterations. |
| **Phase 3: Testing** | Quality Assurance | Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure reliability and performance. Engage QA teams early in the development cycle. |
|  | Load Testing | Simulate traffic for 1 million users using tools like JMeter or Locust to validate scalability and identify bottlenecks. |
|  | User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | Coordinate with business teams for UAT to ensure the system meets business requirements and user expectations. |
| **Phase 4: Deployment** | Pilot Launch | Roll out the system to a limited user base to gather real-world usage data, monitor performance, and collect feedback. |
|  | Monitoring and Optimization | Implement monitoring tools (e.g., PM2, Prometheus, Grafana) to track system performance post-launch. Optimize based on insights gathered. |
